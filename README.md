# AquaSentinel
[https://github.com/PranavaKCode/AquaSentinel_Rough_Draft.git](url)

AquaSentinel is an AI Object Detection project that combats the threat of Lionfish invasion in the Caribbean. 
Using Imagenet, resnet-18, and a complex custom image classification program it accurately identifies Lionfish even in challenging underwater conditions and can alert marine conservation teams, local authorities, or volunteers instantly via email. 
The project's potential impact extends globally, offering a pioneering approach to safeguarding marine ecosystems from invasive species threats, and collecting data on invasive lionfish. 


## The Algorithm
This project uses the resnet-18 model and a custom-made imagenet classification program. The imagenet classification program was created on Jetson Nano and has a multitude of functions. 
Here are its following functions:

**Email Sending: It can send emails to marine conservation teams, local authorities, or volunteers as soon as a lionfish is detected as well as a daily report of how many lionfish were detected on that day using the smtplib and time libraries.(Currently only sends an email to myself as to not false report.)**

Emails:

Daily Email Code(the time.sleep pauses the execution of the code until near midnight):![Daily Email Code](https://i.imgur.com/4VtMPvn.jpg)

**Csv file: It keeps track of how much lionfish are detected per day and shows it in the csv file as well as the terminal**

**Bar graph for data analysis: The bar graph takes the date and count values and shows them in a presentable visual graph.**

**Detection data/logs: The detection data shows what the program has detected and the timestamp, image, class, and confidence rating. 
If it has detected a lionfish it says "**** Found ü¶Åüêü Lion Fish ü¶Åüêü‚úÖ ****" the timestamp and other data and a link to a doc that contains information on what to do.
If it has detected something else resnet-18 knows it says "Found{class name}‚ùå".**

## Running this project

1. Add steps for running this project.
   
   1. Create an email and get its app key password[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXiPshHn9Pw](url))
   2. Log in to VsCode
   3. Connect to nano via remote ssh host
   4. Create a folder in vs code and name it(Ex. my-recognition)
   5. Create or Download from Aquasentinel github(url given at top of this doc) the following files my_recognition.py, lionfish_detection_counts.csv, and detection_data.txt(lionfish_detection_counts.png will be automatically generated after running)
   6. fill out the def send_email(subject, message) function in the my_recognition.py with your email, app key password, and the email(s) of local conservation organizations or authorities.
   7. Type Date,Count into lionfish_detection_counts.csv(ignore if already there) file and paste the my_recognition.py(or drag and drop the files dowloaded) in github into your vscode file.
   8. Run the following commands
      1. cd my-recognition
      2. python3 my_recognition.py (insert image name here and remove parenthesis).jpg  (e.g. python3 my_recognition.py 1Lionfish.jpg)
   9. The program should work as intended.
2. Make sure to include any required libraries that need to be installed for your project to run.

All of these are default libraries that you dont need to install but need to use for the project to work

import csv

import matplotlib

matplotlib.use('Agg')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import matplotlib.cm as cm

import smtplib

from email.mime.text import MIMEText

import time
